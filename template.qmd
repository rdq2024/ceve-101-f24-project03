We begin by loading the required packages.

```{julia}
using Revise                      # <1>
using RainwaterHarvesting         # <2>
```

1. `Revise` allows us to update code without restarting Julia.
2. We load the `RainwaterHarvesting` package that contains our simulation tools.

### Setting the file path

Next, we specify the path to the rainfall data file and read it in.

```{julia}
filepath = "data/83.txt" # <1>   
rainfall_data = RainfallData(filepath) # <2>
```

1. This is the path to the rainfall data file for the station of interest.
2. This creates a `RainfallData` object containing the rainfall data for the specified station.

If we dig under the hood a bit, we can see that there are two main pieces of information:

- `station_info`: a dictionary containing information about the station, such as its name and location.
- `annual_data`: a dictionary mapping years to `AnnualRainfallData` objects, each containing the date and precipitation data for a given year.

### Plotting the Data

We can plot the data for one or all of the years to verify that it looks correct.

```{julia}
plot(rainfall_data) # <1>
```

1. This `plot` function is defined in [viz.jl](./RainwaterHarvesting/src/viz.jl) and is a thin wrapper around the Plots.jl package.

### Discussion

The years that are kept are the number of years present in the graph after cleaning: 49 years. This is a sufficient data sample because of the longevity of time. According to the research, the state of Ceara, Brazil, experienced a drought from 2012 to 2018. My data does contain this period of time; however, based on the data, the region chosen was not hit by this drought because there was no missing data for that time period. Therefore, the data is both sufficient and consistent between all 35 years.

## Understanding the Theoretical Model

Let's explore the model that simulates the rainwater harvesting system.

A limiting assumption is that the consumption of water begins after the rainy season begins, about 150 days into the year and that the average household consumes about 74.1 liters per day. These assumptions can be accounted by modifying the equations to introduce outside variables to allow for flexibility in the water usage model (Accounting for randomness), such as margin of error.

### Mass Balance Equation

The mass balance model for the rainwater tank is given by:

$$
V_{t+1} = V_t + Q_t - C_t | 0 \leq V_t \leq V_\text{max}
$$

- $V_t$: the volume of water in the tank at time $t$
- $Q_t$ is the volume of water added to the tank at time $t$
- $C_t$ is the volume of water consumed at time $t$
- $V_\text{max}$: the maximum volume of the tank

### Inflow ($Q_t$)

Inflow is calculated as

$$
Q_t = \eta \times A \times \max(P_t - F, 0).
$$

- $\eta$: the runoff coefficient, which accounts for losses due to evaporation, spilling, etc.
- $A$: the area of the roof (we will use square meters)
- $P_t$: the precipitation at time $t$ (we will use millimeters per day)
- $F$: the first flush volume (we will use millimeters). The first flush volume is often discarded, so that each time it rains the first bit of water (which is usually dirty) is not used (see [here](https://rainwaterharvesting.tamu.edu/pre-storage-treatment/) for more details).

### Consumption

Consumption is modeled as:

$$
C_t = \begin{cases}
    74.1 & \quad \text{day of year} > 150 \\
    0 & \quad \text{day of year} \leq 150
\end{cases}
$$

This makes two major assumptiuons.
First, the household begins using water from the tank after the 150th day of the year.
This is based on the idea that the rainy season lasts for about the first 150 days of the year, and so they may have other sources of water before then.
The second assumption is that each household consumes 74.1 liters per day during the dry season.

## Model Implementation and Testing

### Defining the Model Parameters

We can define the model parameters with sensible default values.
You will have the opportunity to change these values later.

```{julia}
#| output: false
param = ModelParameters(          # <1>
    runoff_coefficient=0.85,      # <2>
    roof_area_m2=75.0,            # <3>
    first_flush_mm=2.0,           # <4>
    tank_capacity_L=16000.0       # <5>
)
```

1. This creates a `ModelParameters` object with the specified parameters.
2. The runoff coefficient ($\eta$) is a measure of how much of the rain that falls on the roof ends up in the tank.
3. The roof area ($A$) is the area of the roof that the rain falls on.
4. The first flush volume ($V_f$) is the volume of rain that is discarded because it is dirty.
5. The tank capacity ($V_\text{max}$) is the maximum volume of the tank.

The area of the roof was changed from 45 to 75 m2 to allow for a greater amount of surface area for the rainfall to land on. The graph only changed by a little; however, the graph indicates that more water is avilable to fill up the tank earlier/faster than before the parameter was changed.

### Running the Simulation for One Year

Let's run the model for the year 1981.

```{julia}
rainfall_1981 = rainfall_data.annual_data[1981]    # <1>
results_1981 = run_timesteps(rainfall_1981, param) # <2>
p1 = plot(results_1981)                                 # <3>
```

1. We select the annual rainfall data for the year 1981.
2. We run the simulation for the year 1981.
3. We plot the results, again using a `plot` function defined in [viz.jl](./RainwaterHarvesting/src/viz.jl).

To compare rainfall and tank volume:

```{julia}
p2 = plot(rainfall_1981)
plot(p2, p1, layout=(2, 1), size=(1000, 700), link=:x)
```

Observe how the tank's water level responds to rainfall events.
Note any periods when the tank runs dry or overflows.

### Reliability Analysis

We can run simulations for all years, one at a time, and then check how many times the tank runs dry.
You can run simulations for all years at once with the following code:

```{julia}
all_years = sort(collect(keys(rainfall_data.annual_data)))          # <1>
all_results = [run_timesteps(rainfall_data.annual_data[year], param) for year in all_years]   # <2>
any_failures = [!isempty(result.failure_dates) for result in all_results]  # <3>
println("Number of years with failures: ", sum(any_failures), " out of ", length(all_years))  # <4>
```

Since the eqution provided that the failure was 0 out of 49, this code is reliable for this specific region, given the data. The systems reliablility percentage is 100%, which mean this data and code can be used for these specific measuremnts and conditions. 

1. We get all the years in order.
2. We run the simulation for each year.
3. We check if any failures occurred.
4. We print the number of years with failures and the total number of years.
